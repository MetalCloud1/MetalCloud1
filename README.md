# 👋 Hi — I’m Gilberto  
**Cloud · Security · Distributed Systems · Practical ML**

I’m a 19-year-old engineer who learns by building.  
My focus is on cloud infrastructure, secure systems, and scalable software. I prefer to prove ideas by shipping working systems rather than by collecting certifications or tutorials.

## 🚀 What I build (high level)
I build learning systems that force clarity through failure — small, real platforms that expose the hard parts of production engineering.

- **MicroForge** — a cloud-native learning template: Kubernetes + GitOps, identity & secrets workflows, observability and deployment patterns.  
- **NetSentinel** — infrastructure for lightweight threat intelligence, reputation scoring, and observability-driven operations.  
- **LeakGuard** —  detection of compromised passwords and sensitive data.
- **Systems Experiments** — projects exploring RPC, event queues, low-level engineering patterns and automation.

These repos are intentionally practical: they capture decisions, trade-offs, and the lessons that taught me to design better systems.

## 🧠 How I work
- **Systems first.** I prioritize architecture and invariants before adding tools.  
- **Iterate fast.** Build → break → learn → harden.  
- **Document reasoning.** Commits and READMEs should explain why, not just what.  
- **Security by design.** Least privilege, secret rotation, and observable failure modes from day one.  
- **Simplicity over cleverness.** Remove complexity until the system remains robust.

## 🔍 Current focus
- Hardened cloud infrastructure (Kubernetes, Terraform, IAM)  
- Practical DevSecOps: reproducible pipelines and gated delivery  
- Observability as first-class design (metrics, traces, structured logs)  
- Systems thinking applied to reliability and security

---

## 🎯 Principles I follow
- **Clarity > cleverness** — if you can’t explain it simply, it’s not ready.  
- **Design for failure** — make systems fail safely and recover automatically.  
- **Automate guardrails** — humans should choose, machines should enforce.  
- **Learn by building** — theory is useful; production scars teach reality.

## 🔗 Quick repo highlights
- `MicroForge` — cloud learning template (K8s, GitOps, observability)  
- `NetSentinel` — infrastructure + monitoring + reputation scoring  
- `LeakGuard` — sensitive information early detection service.
- `systems-experiments` — assorted low-level and distributed systems work

All projects are honest, evolving, and focused on practical lessons rather than polish. Explore any repo to see the trade-offs I made and the problems I solved.
